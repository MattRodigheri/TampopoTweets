# TampopoTweets

This is an experiment with a Raspberry Pi and a small rodent to see if she can be motivated by food to take a photo of herself and tweet it. Built in Python (perhaps not the most rodent-friendly language...). Also a fun way to learn about hardware. See the twitter account here: https://twitter.com/TampopoTweets
